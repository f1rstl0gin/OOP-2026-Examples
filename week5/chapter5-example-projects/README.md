# Chapter 5 Example Projects (Original)

These three small demos cover the **same concepts** as *Learning Object-Oriented Programming*
(Gastón C. Hillar), **Chapter 5: Interfaces, Multiple Inheritance, and Composition**,
but the code in this folder is **original** (not copied from the textbook).

## Python (Multiple Inheritance + Abstract Base Classes)

Folder: `chapter5-python/`

Run:

```bash
cd chapter5-python
python main.py
```

Key ideas: multiple inheritance, overriding, abstract base classes, MRO.

## JavaScript (Composition with Constructor Functions)

Folder: `chapter5-js/`

Run:

```bash
cd chapter5-js
npm start
```

Key ideas: HAS-A composition, delegation, constructor-function style.

## C# (Interfaces + "Multiple Inheritance" via Interfaces)

Folder: `chapter5-csharp/`

Build/Run (requires .NET SDK):

```bash
cd chapter5-csharp
dotnet run
```

Key ideas: declaring interfaces, implementing multiple interfaces, passing interfaces
as method arguments.
