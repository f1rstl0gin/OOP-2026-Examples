# Week 3 – Encapsulation (JavaScript)

This VS Code project demonstrates encapsulation using `#private` fields and closures.

## Key Ideas

- `#balance` is fully private and enforced by the language.
- The closure example hides state with lexical scope.
- All balance changes flow through `deposit` and `withdraw`.

## Run the example

```bash
node wallet_account.js
```

The script runs a few quick checks to verify the invariants.
