# Week 4 – Inheritance & Polymorphism (JavaScript)

This VS Code project mirrors the Week 4 C# inheritance example using the same account types.

## Highlights

- Base `BankAccount` defines shared behavior.
- `TravelAccount`, `RewardsAccount`, and `StudentAccount` override what differs.
- Polymorphism: treat different accounts uniformly.
- Operator overloading isn't supported in JS; use explicit methods instead.

## Run the example

```bash
node bankAccounts.js
```
