# Week 4 – Polymorphism (Python Notifications)

**Domain:** Notifications (Email, SMS, Push)

## Highlights

- Base class documents the behavioral contract with `send()`.
- Subclasses override the same method name with different behavior.
- The calling loop stays the same as new notification types are added.

## Run the example

```bash
python3 notifications.py
```
