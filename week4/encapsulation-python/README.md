# Week 4 – Inheritance & Polymorphism (Python)

This VS Code project mirrors the Week 4 C# inheritance example using the same account types.

## Highlights

- Base `BankAccount` defines shared behavior.
- `TravelAccount`, `RewardsAccount`, and `StudentAccount` override what differs.
- Polymorphism: treat different accounts uniformly.
- Operator overloading via `__add__` shows when it can be helpful vs. when clearer methods are preferred.

## Run the example

```bash
python3 bank_accounts.py
```
