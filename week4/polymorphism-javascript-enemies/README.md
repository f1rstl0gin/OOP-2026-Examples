# Week 4 – Polymorphism (JavaScript Game Enemies)

**Domain:** Game enemy AI behavior

## Highlights

- Base class defines the expected `attack()` method.
- Each enemy overrides `attack()` with its own behavior.
- The game loop calls `attack()` without caring about the concrete type.

## Run the example

```bash
node enemies.js
```
