# Week 4: Coffee Shop Extension (Inheritance + Overriding)

**Topic:** Inheritance & Polymorphism (Hillar Chapter 4).

**Goal:** Extend the Week 2 project with inheritance and method overriding.

## Inheritance
- `Beverage` base class.
- `Coffee` and `Tea` inherit from `Beverage`.

## Method Overriding
- `Coffee.describe()` and `Tea.describe()` override `Beverage.describe()`.

## Run
```bash
python main.py
```
