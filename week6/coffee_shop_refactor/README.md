# Week 6: Coffee Shop Refactor

**Goal:** Refactor a prior project to improve clarity, modularity, and code reuse.

## Improvements
- **Clarity:** Separated responsibilities into `catalog`, `order`, and `ui` modules.
- **Modularity:** Each module has a single, focused role.
- **Reuse:** `Menu` and `Order` can be reused in other ordering examples.

## Run
```bash
python main.py
```
